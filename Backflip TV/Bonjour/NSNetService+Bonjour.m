/**
 * The following works around three problems with
 * -[NSNetService getInputStream:outputStream:]:
 *
 * o <rdar://problem/6868813> -- Currently the returns the streams with
 * +1 retain count, which is counter to Cocoa conventions and results in
 * leaks when you use it in ARC code.
 *
 * o <rdar://problem/9821932> -- If you create two pairs of streams from
 * one NSNetService and then attempt to open all the streams simultaneously,
 * some of the streams might fail to open.
 *
 * o <rdar://problem/9856751> -- If you create streams using
 * -[NSNetService getInputStream:outputStream:], start to open them, and
 * then release the last reference to the original NSNetService, the
 * streams never finish opening.  This problem is exacerbated under ARC
 * because ARC is better about keeping things out of the autorelease pool.
